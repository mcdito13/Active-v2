# Active Version 2.0

This is my second go at Active, and activity logging application. This version was written 
using Node.js and PostgreSQL for the backend, and Pug and Bootstrap for the frontend. It 
is currently hosted on the Heroku Cloud Platform [here](https://active-app.herokuapp.com/).
